# UnityEssentials2024

These are the project files I created to complete the [Unity Essentials 2024 tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials).

The game is running online on the Unity Play platform, and you can access it via this [link](https://play.unity.com/en/games/c13eebd7-6af7-424c-afa5-ea73af099144/unity-essentials-2024-project).

For those who want to explore the project but haven't completed Unity Essentials, here is a summary of each scene you can access in the project:

1. Playground Navigation - This scene teaches the basics of navigating the Unity Editor (by finding the numbers of the code throughout the scene), so there are almost no modifications from me, except for an added tub slide. Note: The code is 2004.
2. Kids Room - This scene covers various 3D fundamentals. You will see a small system I built where a ball hits and knocks down several block towers. Additionally, you will see some pictures added by me.
3. Kitchen Audio - This scene teaches the fundamentals of Unity Audio. You can enter and listen to a background soundtrack [source of the sound] and the sound of water bubbling in a pot, along with the occasional chirping of a bird. Note: You can move using WASD.
4. Living Room - This scene focuses on scripting in Unity. I built a small car that you can control around the scene, collecting some stars. Note: You can move using WASD and jump with the spacebar.
5. TopDown2D - This scene is very similar to scene 4 but in 2D. The differences are that the car is replaced by a UFO, and you must move furniture to collect some stars. Note: You can move using WASD.
6. Home Explorer - In this scene, the tutorial allows us to create a bonus stage in our own way. I expanded the scene from Living Room (scene 4), enabling the player to walk through the entire house and playground to collect the stars. Note: You can move using WASD and jump with the spacebar.
